Hi, Spring fans! In this installment we look at how to [use Openrewrite to move to the latest-and-greatest version of Spring Boot ](https://docs.openrewrite.org/recipes/java/spring/boot3/upgradespringboot_3_0)

I've configured the OpenRewrite plugin in the Gradle build. Run it:

```shell
./gradlew rewriteDryRun
```

or 

```shell
./gradlew rewriteRun
```
